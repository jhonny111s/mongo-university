## Question

Which optimization will typically have the greatest impact on the performance of a database?

## Answer

- adding more memory so that the working set fits in memory
- adding a faster drive so that operations that hit disk will happen more quickly.
- replacing your CPU with a faster one (say one 2x as fast)
- adding appropriate indexes on large collections so that only a small percentage of queries need to scan the collection.


## Result

- adding appropriate indexes on large collections so that only a small percentage of queries need to scan the collection.
